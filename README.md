# better-multi-twitch
A multiple Twitch.tv stream viewer with robust viewing options, stream layouts, and usage of the legacy chat* so that FFZ and BTTV actually work like they used to.

*I suspect one day Twitch will remove legacy chat as well, but until then, rejoyce.

To actually use the app, go here: https://nick-kree.github.io/better-multi-twitch/
