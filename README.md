# better-multi-twitch
A multiple Twitch.tv stream viewer with robust viewing options, stream layouts, and usage of the legacy chat* so that FFZ and BTTV actually work like they used to. Streams will adapt to any browser window size and automatically change layouts to give you the best view of all the streams and chats that you have selected. Also allows you to manually place and resize any video or chat yourself (though these positions are lost upon page refresh).

**I suspect one day Twitch will remove legacy chat as well, but until then, rejoyce.*

To actually use the app, go here: https://nick-kree.github.io/better-multi-twitch/

You can also download it and use it on your computer if you feel like it. You just need the HTML, JS, and CSS files in the same directory. Might be useful if you've got improvements you'd like to make. Maybe one day I will allow contributors, and you can show them off.

Should work with up to 4 streams, but may be buggy as I haven't rewritten the code for any more than 1 stream to use the new layout algorithms. Yeah, yeah, "multi" Twitch LUL; I was literally in the middle of rewriting the app when I decided to upload it to GitHub, so it is what it is. I haven't decided on how the layout algorithms will work for additional streams yet. Also, I disabled the manual resizing at the time of the initial upload, because it was in the way, but I will get it reinstated shortly.
